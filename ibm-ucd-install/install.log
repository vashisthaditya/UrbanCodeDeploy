     [echo] Do you accept the license? [y,n]
     [echo] 
Installing IBM UrbanCode Deploy version 7.0.0.0.984935

     [echo] Enter the directory where the IBM UrbanCode Deploy should be installed. [Default: C:\Program Files\ibm-ucd\server]
     [echo] 
Installing IBM UrbanCode Deploy to: C:\Program Files\ibm-ucd\server

     [echo] JVM Version detected: 1.8.0_251
     [echo] JAVA_HOME: C:\Program Files\Java\jre1.8.0_251

     [echo] Will this server be used as a node in a high availability cluster? y,N [Default: N]
     [echo] Where should the server store application data such as logs, plugins, and keystores? [Default: C:\Program Files\ibm-ucd\server/appdata]
     [echo] What host name will users access the Web UI at? [Default: NCBWIN.dn0uyrh341wezdtxaqyxkaffih.bx.internal.cloudapp.net]
     [echo] Do you want the Web UI to always use secure connections using SSL? Y,n [Default: Y]
     [echo] Enter the port on which the Web UI should listen for HTTP requests. [Default: 8080]
     [echo] Enter the initial password for the admin user.
     [echo] Please type password again.
     [echo] Enter the port to use for JMS agent communication. [Default: 7918]
     [echo] Do you want the Server and Agent communication to require mutual authentication? This requires a manual key exchange between the server and each agent. See the documentation for more details. y,N [Default: N]
     [echo] UCD's web-based replacement for JMS agent communication requires a URL that is used to set a listening port and to allow servers to exchange agent messages.
     [echo] The URL has the following requirements:
     [echo] 1) The URL must have the form "wss://<host-or-ip>:<port>". Example: wss://ucd1.example.org:7919
     [echo] 2) The URL port must not conflict with ports for the UI or JMS.
     [echo] 3) Each server must have a distinct URL.
     [echo] 4) Every server in an HA cluster must be able to connect directly to this server with the URL.
     [echo] 5) Agents and relays must be able to connect to one or more servers at their respective URL port.
     [echo] Agents and relays may be configured to use a common URL shared by all servers (for example, one provided by a load balancer), but servers must be configured with direct URLs.
     [echo] Enter the web agent communication URL for this server. [Default: wss://NCBWIN.dn0uyrh341wezdtxaqyxkaffih.bx.internal.cloudapp.net:7919]
     [echo] Enter the port and hostname of a Rational License Key Server containing product licenses for UrbanCode Deploy, in the form of port@hostname. (e.g. 27000@licenses.example.com) Alternatively, you may leave this blank to begin a 60-day evaluation period. [Default: none]
     [echo] When installing a server as a part of an existing cluster or when using a pre-populated database, it is not necessary to create the database schema. This step must be performed when installing a standalone server to a fresh database or when installing the first server in a cluster.
     [echo] Create database schema? (For high availability servers, this should only be done for the first server in the cluster) Y,n [Default: Y]
     [echo] The following database types are supported: derby, mysql, oracle, sqlserver, db2, db2zos.
     [echo] Enter the database type to use. [Default: derby]
     [echo] Enter the database username. [Default: ucd]
     [echo] Enter the database password. [Default: password]
